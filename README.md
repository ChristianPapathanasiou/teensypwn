Teensy 3.1 USB HID reverse shell for Mac

Teensypwn turns your Teensy 3.1 into an attacker demo toolkit whereby once the Teensy is plugged into any USB port on a MacOSX machine, 
a terminal is opened, reverse shell instructions typed, and window quickly closed so as to minimise overt attention.

When the .ipo file is uploaded to the Teensy, all these instructions rest within the Teensy's firmware and hence no endpoint malware detection 
is able to scan or prevent such an attack from happening.

Created for demo purposes only, no liability accepted.
